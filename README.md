## Dose response + variational inference + scRNA + ??? = drvish

Repository for modeling single-cell expression data along with dose-response data using stochastic variational inference. Heavily inspired by the scVI project from Nir Yosef's lab as UC Berkeley, but adapted to use the Pyro PPL for inference.

Very much a work in progress.
