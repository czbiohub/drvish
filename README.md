## Dose response + variational inference + scRNA + ??? = drvish

Repository for modeling single-cell expression data along with dose-response data using stochastic variational inference. Heavily inspired by the [scVI](https://github.com/YosefLab/scVi) project from [Nir Yosef's lab as UC Berkeley](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/), but adapted to use [Pyro](https://pyro.ai) for inference.

Very much a work in progress. Discussion welcome via issues and PRs.
